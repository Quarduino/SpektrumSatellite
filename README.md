# SpektrumSatellite
Rx receiver library for Arduino DUE and the Spektrum DSMX Satellite receiver. 
Probably works with other Arduinos with some modifications like changing all shorts to ints.
Before using, change which serial port the library should read from in SpektrumSattelite.cpp. Default is Serial3.
